## Features
1. Create and record multiple custom gesture samples. 
2. Train the ML model based on custom gesture recordings.
3. Running pre-trained models to real-time recognition of musical gestures based on audio input.
4. Output recognition result via OSC/MIDI.
5. Save/load the trained ML model and configuration.
6. Support for multiple input channels (Coming soon)
